{\footnotesize\ttfamily void door\+\_\+logic (\begin{DoxyParamCaption}\item[{int $\ast$}]{inside,  }\item[{int $\ast$}]{up,  }\item[{int $\ast$}]{down,  }\item[{int $\ast$}]{next,  }\item[{int}]{current\+\_\+floor,  }\item[{int}]{last\+\_\+direction }\end{DoxyParamCaption})}



Uses timer.\+h and stops for 3 seconds when the door would open. As long as {\ttfamily hardware\+\_\+read\+\_\+stop\+\_\+signal} or {\ttfamily hardware\+\_\+read\+\_\+obstruction\+\_\+signal} is active the door will stay open. Door will also stay open for 3 seconds after {\ttfamily hardware\+\_\+read\+\_\+stop\+\_\+signal} goes low. 

Opens the doors, then starts the timer. It will remain in the while loop as long as the timer is less than 3 seconds, and it will be reset every time the stop button or obstruction is activated. After 3 seconds it will close the doors, then return from the function.
